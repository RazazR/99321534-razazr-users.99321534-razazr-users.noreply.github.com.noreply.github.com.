Beside incorporating a lot of bug fixes, ProtoBuf.js 4.0 now supports [proto3 syntax](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3) and got a new CLI utility named `pbjs`, which replaces `proto2js` and `json2proto` and uses more intuitive command line options ([see](https://github.com/dcodeIO/ProtoBuf.js/wiki/pbjs)).
